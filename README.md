The Real Estate Management System is a web application that allows users to manage properties, including posting, editing, and deleting properties for sellers, and searching for properties based on various filters for buyers. The system provides separate dashboards for sellers and buyers.

**Features:**
1. **Seller Dashboard:**
   - Post new properties with details such as location, price, area, bedrooms, and bathrooms.
   - View a list of properties posted by the seller.
   - Edit and delete properties.

2. **Buyer Dashboard:**
   - Search for properties based on location, price range, area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
   - View a list of properties matching the search criteria.

**File Structure:**
```
- index.html
- login.html
- register.html
- buyer-dashboard.html
- seller-dashboard.html
- script.js
- style.css
- img/
  - villa1.jpg

```

**Usage:**
1. Open `index.html` to access the homepage.
2. Navigate to `login.html` to log in or `register.html` to register as a new user.
3. After logging in, sellers can access the seller dashboard (`seller-dashboard.html`) to manage properties, while buyers can access the buyer dashboard (`buyer-dashboard.html`) to search for properties.
4. Sellers can post new properties, edit existing properties, and delete properties from the seller dashboard.
